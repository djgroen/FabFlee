5, 2020-05-15, fishermen advised away from the bay until 18th. 
6, 2020-05-16, cyclone formed/detected, assume no flood in all areas (flood_level=0) before this day
7, 2020-05-17, Day A - 1 form each flood level to simulate rapid intensification reported. rapid intensivication, became extreme cyclonic storm. Some evacuations began in Odisha and West Bengal.
8, 2020-05-18, Day A. assume flood levels seen on day A are present at the peak of the flood, when cylone tarts. 12:00 UTC peak cyclone intensity over bay of bengal. Bangladesj Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) issued highest danger signal 10 for the coastal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalokathi, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barishal, Laxmipur, Chandpur, Noakhali, Feni, Chattogram, and their offshore islands and chars.
9, 2020-05-19, Day A. weakened due to dry air and wind shear. Damaging effects began in Bangladesh prior to the landfall of Amphan as coastal water levels rose.
10, 2020-05-20, Day A.  12:00 UTC landfall over west bengal. Assume camps are full at this point. 2.2 million people evacuated in Bangladesh. https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cyclone-amphan-nears-4-2mn-evacuated-in-coastal-regions-of-india-b-desh/story-bpZ14tH5LNaaDNckvZknDK.html
11, 2020-05-21, Day A. dissipated, well marked low pressure area
12, 2020-05-22, Actual Day A data = assume this is peak flood levels
13, 2020-05-23, Assume flood levels remain high, they could dissapate, little difference between day 12 and 18, so assume they remain high.
